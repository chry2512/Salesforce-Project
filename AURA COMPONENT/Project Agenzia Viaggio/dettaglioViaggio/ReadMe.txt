In this project an aura component is created for a hypothetical travel agency, 
the user searches for the desired trip,
selects it and is redirected to a page that shows the main details of the trip and the price, 
once the trip is confirmed, a account associated with the related trip and a booking confirmation e-mail is sent to the user.
